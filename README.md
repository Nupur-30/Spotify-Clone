This is one of my first frontend-web dev projects. It aims to mimic the user interface of the popular music streaming service, Spotify. 

Technologies used: - HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, Google FONTS & ICONS.

The clone includes a header with a search bar and navigation menu, a main section displaying music tracks with album covers, track names, and artist names, and a footer with basic information and links related to the Spotify app. 

I immensely enjoyed working on this project, getting to learn a lot of new things. I have made the website responsive at certain dimensions.
Going to add more features soon!
